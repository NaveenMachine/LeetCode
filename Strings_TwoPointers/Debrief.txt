The TWO POINTER algorithm involves traversing through an array with two pointers/
to find pairs of numbers. If the numbers are sorted it results in a O(n)

Questions to Ask:
    - What does my input look like?
    - Will the sum cause integer overflow?

How to find better solutions:
    - Find insights from simple solution or problem statement
    - Ask for a hint
    - Find algorithms based off of runtimes

Typical O (N Log N) Algos:
    - Sort and scan
    - Scan through array and use binary search


*** NOTES ***
- If an array of numbers are already sorted look into using Binary Search. (nlogn)
